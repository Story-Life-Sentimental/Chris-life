								<p>My darling:</p>
<p>  How is everything going these days?Is where you study the same hot as where I am?Do you still remember when we met last time?</p>
<p>  It's gonna be almost half a year,but I still remember 君の声も,君の顔も and even those 不器用なとこも.In my eyes,they are not "不器用",they are the reason why you are so cute and precious.you're always in my heart——actually,your ghost is always haunting me dream.</p>
<p>  In order to enter that senior high school,your father paid a lot for you.That's what I heard before,I really wonder why didn't you come here.You have friends here,and,you have me here.I also heard that the school you study in is going to be more strict this year.I know you like freedom,is it hard for you to study these days,my cute Yuki?</p>
<p>  Have you got used to the new environment?At least I haven't,I can't be excellent as before without you next to me.I just suffered from an exam,they pue Jesus' followers into the text.I was like an idiot.I'm worse than before now.Please,I need you.</p>
<p>  Maybe in you eyes,I am always a reliable person.However,actually I'm not exactly who you think I am.I am just good at pretending.Therefore,the person you see is not the complete edition.It's a shell without soul.I'm sorry for that.ごめんね</p>
<p>  Can we meet once again?And can you still accept the person who is beyond redemption?</p>
