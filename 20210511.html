								<p>We all have some unforgettable experiecnes in our daily life,once upon a time,I had an embarrassing experience.</p>
<p>We had an exam last week,and one of my friends say in front of me at that time.His father told him that if he could get good grades,he would get a new phone that only belongs to him.</p>
<p>When I was writing,he passed me a piece of paper and told me that he wanted to get good grades,he hoped that I could help him cheat,looking at me hopefully.</p>
<p>I refused,but he didn't give up,he started to say dirty words to me.</p>
<p>Finally,I couldn't fucking stand,so I helped him.</p>
<p>I never thought that decision would be my worst decision.</p>
<p>To my surprise,he got better grades than me.When my teacher asked me why I did worse than him,I shouted,"He was such an idiot!Did you REALLY know him?He was a fucking cheater!"</p>
<p>My teacher didn't believe me,my classmates started to laugh,they thought I was the idiot who was crazy about good grades.</p> 
<p>……</p>
<p>I made he who he is today.</p>
<p>Since then,he started to like cheating in the exam.</p>
<p>Because of this,he didn't work hard any longer.</p>
<p>I thought he could enter a good school and get a good education.</p>
<p>But I changed that,I made him lazy,I made him work no longer hard.</p>
<p>He has fallen into the abyss.</p>
<p>And the person who threw him into the abyss,I think,it's me.</p>
